    The list of service identities (Google Managed service account for the API) to force-create for the project (e.g. in order to grant additional roles).
    APIs in this list will automatically be appended to `activate_apis`.
    Not including the API in this list will follow the default behaviour for identity creation (which is usually when the first resource using the API is created).
    Any roles (e.g. service agent role) must be explicitly listed. See https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#service-agent-roles-roles for a list of related roles.
